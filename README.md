# CatchTheKing

1-The purpose of the game is to open the cards on the table with the cards in your own deck and earn the highest score.

2-For every card you open on the board, you get 10 times the value of the card you open.
If you open all cards horizontally, vertically or diagonally, you will get extra 10 points.

3-You can open the smaller or equal value cards on the board with the cards in your deck except for the 5 and K cards.

4-If the value of the card on the board is less than the value of the card in your hand, you will get your score 
and the card in your hand will not burn.

If the value of the card in your hand is equal to the value of the card on the board, you will get your point, 
but the card in your hand will burn.

If the value of the card on the board is greater than the value of the card in your hand, 
the value of the card on the board appears for a short time and is closed again. The card in your hand will burn.

5-When you select each card on the board, if there is a 5-value card around that card, "5 ALERT" warning is displayed.

If you do not see the "5 ALERT" warning, it means that there is no 5-value card around the card you opened.

6-You can use the cards in your deck in order. You cannot use 2-value cards until the 1-value cards in your hand are finished.

7-When using 5-value cards, if there is a 5-value card around the card you have opened on the board,
you cannot get points and the card in your hand will burn.

8-The K card in your hand is for single use only. If you open the K card on the board with the K card, you will get 100 points.
